Unlike City of Villains, Going Rogue was an expansion rather than a Stand Alone and required the original game(s) to play. Going Rogue added an Alignment system, which allowed players to switch from Hero to Villain and added two intermediate Alignments: Vigilante, as a player progresses from Hero to Villain, and Rogue, as a player progresses from Villain to Hero. Players with Vigilante or Rogue characters had access to both City of Heroes's Paragon City and City of Villains's Rogue Isles until they change to Hero or Villain. The expansion also added the Praetorian Earth dimension where players could start out as neutrally-aligned Praetorians (choosing any of the ten basic Archetypes available to Heroes or Villains), either deciding to side with Emperor Cole's ruling faction and become a Loyalist or side with the Resistance; the allegiance could change as the player chose and completed missions. Praetorian players could also attack new Neutral mobs and would eventually be able to play a mission that allowed them to choose to be a Hero or Villain and complete gameplay in the original games. Going Rogue also granted access to four new power sets, new costume sets and auras, and introduced missions that started after defeating mobs that affected the player's Alignment.","collections":[{"id":2263,"games":[7830,20457,20458]}]},{"id":105769,"name":"Hotel Transylvania: Crazy Cruise","platforms":[{"id":34,"name":"Android"}],"release_dates":[{"id":208837,"human":"2018","region":8}]},{"id":130909,"name":"TimeWatch"},{"id":57930,"cover":{"id":35311,"image_id":"alpdb97bwcn5gzhrpcnm"},"genres":[{"id":12,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)"}],"name":"Sacred Seasons 2","platforms":[{"id":82,"name":"Web browser"}],"release_dates":[{"id":510210,"human":"Apr 28, 2010","region":8}],"summary":"The Sequel to Sacred Seasons."},{"id":100961,"name":"Super Craft: Exploration Survival"},{"id":184809,"genres":[{"id":34,"name":"Visual Novel"}],"name":"Robomancer_000","screenshots":[{"id":699310,"image_id":"scezla"},{"id":699311,"image_id":"scezlb"},{"id":699312,"image_id":"scezlc"},{"id":699313,"image_id":"scezld"}],"summary":"Robomancer_000 is a visual novel in which you're Jyoti.

Everything is almost like in life.\n\nSeveral mini-games are waiting for you, which will definitely not let you get bored, and will challenge you to a new record.\n\nIn Platform Hero you have to literally survive using a grappling hook and a firearm, clinging to platforms. But this will not last long: the hook does not hold up, and the platform keeps dropping. It's time to catch on to another, but no matter how it is: the enemy is moving towards the hero. It's time to use your weapon.\n\nAnother mini-game in the space network is Planetoids . The goal is the same - to get points, simultaneously destroying asteroids. Here you have complete control over the ship, and the asteroids themselves are split into pieces, which can be caught game over once again.\n\nDino Island - a runner in which you play as a dinosaur. You have to jump over stones and trees and periodically turn into a pterodactyl, also flying around obstacles.","summary":"A.S.T.R.A. - a game made in 2D hand-drawn graphics, which is a collection of various mini-games in different genres.

Similarly to its predecessor, it's an action-strategy game where the player must manage his funds and personally prepare all the dishes for the customers.\n\nBefore the start of each day, the player can spend money to purchase expansions for his restaurant, including new food menu items and proper equipment. Once the day starts, the player must manage his time carefully to cater to all the customers and the restaurant's needs from morning till closing hours.\n\nThroughout the day, new customers keep coming in and ordering food, and events (such as the need to wash dishes or a fire in the kitchen) require the manager's attention. Each customer and event is represented by a gradually vanishing bar. Preparing food and caring for problems is usually done through a simple, action minigame. The player can only take on one of these at a time, but it is possible to serve prepared meals to customers in the middle of something else.\n\nEach customer expects his food to be prepared strictly according to order. If the player messes something up by adding the wrong ingredients or by under- or overcooking the food, the customer will pay less. And if a customer waits too long without their order being attended to, they get furious and leave, causing a minor monetary penalty. Things get even more hectic during the \"Rush Hour\" that comes twice daily, during which large crowds of customers keep coming in.\n\nOre no Ryomi 2 also contains several \"Challenges\": the player, invited to the Iron Chef TV show, tries to complete a specific difficult task, such as preparing many perfect dishes in a limited time.

Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the Bemani series, and released in North America and Europe in 1999, Dance Dance Revolution is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance genre in video games. Players stand on a \"dance platform\" or stage and hit colored arrows laid out in a cross with their feet to musical and visual cues. Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score.\n\nDance Dance Revolution has been given much critical acclaim for its originality and stamina in the video game market. There have been dozens of arcade-based releases across several countries and hundreds of home video game console releases, promoting a music library of original songs produced by Konami's in-house artists and an eclectic set of licensed music from many different genres.

The gameplay consists of navigating a dungeon using an innovative portal system. The player controls a pair of interconnected portals that can be placed on any non-metallic surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). Gabe Newell, managing director of Valve Corporation, took interest in the team's work and employed the whole staff at Valve.

These can be laptops, desktops, or Android devices. \nOne big screen (large monitor, TV, or projector). \nA stable network. Wifi can work, but we recommend a wired LAN. \nIf playing over the internet, voice chat is strongly recommended. \nAll but 1 of the officers operate \"stations\" that control different parts of the ship. The last computer is for the main screen, which does not need any input and should be visible to all players. \n \nDesignate 1 player as Captain, whose computer can serve as the ship's main screen. The Captain's only duty is to communicate with the other officers and tell them what they should do. \n \nThe other officers each operate one of the ship's stations, which are described in the Stations tab. \n \nRunning the game \nAfter starting the game on the computer serving as the main screen, you can also configure it as the game server. The other stations can then connect to the game server as clients. \n \nAfter starting the server, select a scenario (we recommend the \"Waves\" or \"Basic\" scenarios for first games), then spawn a player ship for everyone to join. \n \nEveryone should select the same ship and choose their designated station. That's it! You're now in command of a fully functional spaceship. \n \nInternet play \nA crew can play EmptyEpsilon over internet connections. This means the game server needs to be accessible from the internet. The server runs on port 35666, which needs to be open in your firewall and forwarded to your server if you are behind a router.","summary":"What is it? \nEmptyEpsilon is a spaceship bridge simulator game. It's fully open source, so it can be modified in any way people wish. \n \nWhat does this mean? \nEmptyEpsilon places you in the roles of a spaceship's bridge officers, like those seen in Star Trek. While you can play EmptyEpsilon alone or with friends, the best experience involves 6 players working together on each ship. \n \nEach officer fills a unique role: Captain, Helms, Weapons, Relay, Science, and Engineering. Except for the Captain, each officer operates part of the ship through a specialized screen. The Captain relies on their trusty crew to report information and follow orders. \n \nLike Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator? \nArtemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator was the inspiration for EmptyEpsilon. It's pretty good as a bridge simulator, but we had some issues with it that we wanted to fix. Since Artemis isn't open source, our only solution was to start over by ourselves. \n \nFor example, the \"comms\" station of Artemis is pretty limited and can be boring for the player. The game could fall out of sync, confusing the players. Also, its Game Master screen didn't do everything that we wanted. \n \nAll in all, Artemis is a nice game.

The aircraft either come flying in on the screen and have preset exit or landing points or show up as wanting to take off with an exit point. It is the player's job to determine the route each aircraft flies and when they may land or take off.\n\nThe aircraft cannot be too close to each other, so the player needs to make sure that they are passing each other on different flight levels or with sufficient distance (three grid dots north/south or east/west) between them. When an aircraft is in danger of crashing or is exiting at the wrong location or altitude, the aircraft will inform the air traffic controller. Aircraft do not change course/altitude unless the player tells them to. Incoming aircraft not given clearance to land, however, will go into a holding pattern and wait until given clearance. When necessary, the player can also give holding instructions to aircraft, as long as their course takes them over a VOR tower which is used as the holding fix.\n\nTo start with, there are few flights at the same time, but at higher GS levels, there are many flights that need management at the same time. Also storms which the aircraft can not pass through show up and some aircraft have very little fuel and have to land fast or they will crash."},{"id":42403,"cover":{"id":120551,"image_id":"co2l0n"},"genres":[{"id":25,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"}],"name":"The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes","platforms":[{"id":58,"name":"Super Famicom"}],"release_dates":[{"id":542758,"human":"Mar 17, 1995","region":5}],"screenshots":[{"id":409664,"image_id":"sc8s3k"},{"id":409665,"image_id":"sc8s3l"},{"id":409666,"image_id":"sc8s3m"}],"summary":"The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes is an action game released in 1995 for the Super Famicom, showcasing the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man.

They each have different missions, lives, and personalities. They also often come together, especially for heists, a complex type of mission where a large operation needs to be planned and executed by determining a strategy and hiring additional henchmen. As with previous games in the series, the gameplay involves gunfights and takes place in a sprawling, open-world city where players get around by acquiring transport (cars, boats, helicopters, etc) through less than legal means. Players can roam the game world, complete story missions, and partake in various illegal activities, including shooting civilians, robbing people, destruction of cars, and the titular act of car theft. These lead to a wanted rating of up to five stars, sending in a police force in pursuit. Continuing to resist the police will also increase it.

The scenery consists of a few trees and a river which you can only cross by bridge. If you shoot an active tank, one of the dormant tanks will spring to life and come after you. The object of the game is to clear the level and go on to the next one before they kill you. Each succeeding level has more enemies, and moves faster and faster. The game plays a tune at the start of each level, and then there is a JAWS-like tune that it plays as you play. As the battle gets more and more frantic, so does the music.
