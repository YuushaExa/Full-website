Two teams compete with each other to reach their ultimate goal: the PARADOX THIEVES, who want to steal history's most precious treasures, and the GUARDIANS OF TIME, who want to restore time and prevent its collapse. To play, both teams must choose players to be their respective captains; only the captains are allowed to look at the screen during the game. For each mission, the captains must look the century and category of the desired goal and tell the other players, who will try to guess what it is and win the goal for them.

These personified warships are based on real-life vessels which are explained in detail within the game; the physical characteristics, appearances and personalities of each of the girls correlate in some way to the real-life vessel (for example, ships with a larger displacement tonnage are usually depicted as older girls with more mature bodies, while smaller ships have petite and underdeveloped figures, with a few exceptions). The player takes on the role of an admiral and organizes their fleets in battle in order to win. Combat is largely automated, and manual actions by the player include micromanagement such as building and repairing.","collections":[{"id":1686,"games":[{"id":11461,"cover":{"id":119941,"image_id":"co2kjp"},"first_release_date":1455753600,"name":"KanColle Kai"},{"id":12737,"cover":{"id":127625,"image_id":"co2qh5"},"first_release_date":1366675200,"name":"Kantai Collection"},{"id":205935,"cover":{"id":228554,"image_id":"co4wcq"},"first_release_date":1461628800,"name":"KanColle Arcade"}]}]},{"id":89521,"name":"E Quotes Trivia: Movies, TV, Music, Books"},{"id":105778,"name":"Otome Games: Is It Love?

The player's body is governed by ragdoll physics, meaning that sometimes some rocking or swinging motions are needed in order to get close enough to make use of a handhold.

As on Earth, this expansion also led to competition and fighting over available resources, but everything changed with the discovery of a natural wormhole leading to an unexplored galaxy subsequently dubbed \"New Eden.\" Dozens of colonies were founded, and a structure, a gate of sorts (which bears the inscription \"EVE\" on the New Eden side), was built to stabilize the wormhole that linked the colonies of New Eden with the rest of human civilization. However, when the wormhole unexpectedly collapsed, it destroyed the gate as well as the connection between the colonies of New Eden and the Milky Way. Cut off from the rest of humanity and supplies from Earth, the colonies of New Eden were left starving and disconnected from one another; many died out entirely. Over the millennia the descendants of the surviving colonists managed to rebuild their own societies, but by this time the memories and knowledge of humanity's origins, of Earth and the Milky Way galaxy, as well as the history of the settling of New Eden, was lost; what little information that survived transmission over the generations was misunderstood, lost in translation, and/or consigned to mythology. Five major distinct societies rose to prominence from the surviving colonies, each growing into interstellar spaceflight-capable civilizations. The states based around these societies make up the five major factions in Eve Online: the Amarr Empire, the Caldari State, the Gallente Federation, the Minmatar Republic and the Jove Directorate.","summary":"EVE Online is a free MMORPG sci-fi strategy game where you can embark on your own unique space adventure.

The weapons to complete these objectives, besides machine guns, are a limited number of bombs, rockets and torpedoes. On some missions, the player must also sink Japanese vessels, such as destroyers, battleships, and aircraft carriers. The player has a finite amount of fuel and munitions, which can be replenished by returning to the carrier.

Going Rogue added an Alignment system, which allowed players to switch from Hero to Villain and added two intermediate Alignments: Vigilante, as a player progresses from Hero to Villain, and Rogue, as a player progresses from Villain to Hero. Players with Vigilante or Rogue characters had access to both City of Heroes's Paragon City and City of Villains's Rogue Isles until they change to Hero or Villain. The expansion also added the Praetorian Earth dimension where players could start out as neutrally-aligned Praetorians (choosing any of the ten basic Archetypes available to Heroes or Villains), either deciding to side with Emperor Cole's ruling faction and become a Loyalist or side with the Resistance; the allegiance could change as the player chose and completed missions. Praetorian players could also attack new Neutral mobs and would eventually be able to play a mission that allowed them to choose to be a Hero or Villain and complete gameplay in the original games. Going Rogue also granted access to four new power sets, new costume sets and auras, and introduced missions that started after defeating mobs that affected the player's Alignment.","collections":[{"id":2263,"games":[{"id":7830,"cover":{"id":354220,"image_id":"co7lbg"},"first_release_date":1083024000,"name":"City of Heroes"},{"id":20457,"cover":{"id":91293,"image_id":"co1yfx"},"first_release_date":1128124800,"name":"City of Villains"},{"id":20458,"cover":{"id":16242,"image_id":"k4ufeing3fwoi99jhv83"},"first_release_date":1280620800,"name":"City of Heroes: Going Rogue"}]}]},{"id":105769,"name":"Hotel Transylvania: Crazy Cruise","platforms":[{"id":34,"name":"Android"}],"release_dates":[{"id":208837,"human":"2018","region":8}]},{"id":130909,"name":"TimeWatch"},{"id":57930,"cover":{"id":35311,"image_id":"alpdb97bwcn5gzhrpcnm"},"genres":[{"id":12,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)"}],"name":"Sacred Seasons 2","platforms":[{"id":82,"name":"Web browser"}],"release_dates":[{"id":510210,"human":"Apr 28, 2010","region":8}],"summary":"The Sequel to Sacred Seasons."},{"id":100961,"name":"Super Craft: Exploration Survival"},{"id":184809,"genres":[{"id":34,"name":"Visual Novel"}],"name":"Robomancer_000","screenshots":[{"id":699310,"image_id":"scezla"},{"id":699311,"image_id":"scezlb"},{"id":699312,"image_id":"scezlc"},{"id":699313,"image_id":"scezld"}],"summary":"Robomancer_000 is a visual novel in which you're Jyoti.

The game is a sequel to Renegade and was followed by Renegade 3. When acquiring the license to convert the original arcade game Renegade to home computers, Ocean acquired the option to produce and release their own home-computer-only sequels to the game, and Target Renegade was the first of these sequels.\n\nOn most formats, the game caters for one or two players and concerns itself with the adventures of a streetfighter (or a pair of identical streetfighters) known only as \"Renegade\", who seek(s) revenge against a local crime kingpin named \"Mr. Big\" for murdering his or their brother Matt. The player character varies, depending on the format, but is usually represented as topless apart from a leather vest and wearing jeans.\n\nRegardless of the format, the cover of the game and the title screen (as seen on the image to the right) portrays a topless street fighter performing a flying kick through a window. In keeping with video game box art and advertising of the era, the character shown in this illustration bears little relation to any character in the game itself. The actual picture is based on Martial Arts Legend Joe Lewis from the cover of his book The World's Greatest Fighter Teaches You How To Master Bruce Lee's Fighting System, but has been adjusted so as to fit in with the character of Renegade.\n\nThe game comprises five levels, though details of enemies and weapons vary from one version to another (the NES version in particular is more like Double Dragon than the home computer versions). The NES and C64 versions of the game do not have a two-player co-operative mode.","collections":[{"id":2777,"games":[{"id":6852,"cover":{"id":195752,"image_id":"co471k"},"first_release_date":567907200,"name":"Renegade"},{"id":39060,"cover":{"id":230221,"image_id":"co4xn1"},"first_release_date":570672000,"name":"Target: Renegade"},{"id":39062,"cover":{"id":230181,"image_id":"co4xlx"},"first_release_date":631065600,"name":"Renegade III: The Final Chapter"},{"id":105703,"cover":{"id":136744,"image_id":"co2xig"},"first_release_date":1406160000,"name":"Arcade Archives: Renegade"},{"id":191644,"cover":{"id":209980,"image_id":"co4i0s"},"first_release_date":533779200,"name":"Renegade"},{"id":255243,"cover":{"id":312420,"image_id":"co6p2c"},"first_release_date":757296000,"name":"Renegade"},{"id":255262,"cover":{"id":377000,"image_id":"co82w8"},"first_release_date":567907200,"name":"Renegade"},{"id":255309,"cover":{"id":312492,"image_id":"co6p4c"},"first_release_date":599529600,"name":"Renegade"},{"id":255318,"cover":{"id":312493,"image_id":"co6p4d"},"first_release_date":623203200,"name":"Renegade"},{"id":255319,"cover":{"id":312974,"image_id":"co6phq"},"first_release_date":599529600,"name":"Renegade"}]}]},{"id":69779,"genres":[{"id":13,"name":"Simulator"}],"name":"ER","summary":"Life and death in the trauma room."},{"id":57404,"cover":{"id":38314,"image_id":"fm6pluzktjdekxsrutpk"},"genres":[{"id":9,"name":"Puzzle"}],"name":"Numbo Jumbo","summary":"A puzzle game from Wombo Combo."},{"id":62243,"cover":{"id":202868,"image_id":"co4cj8"},"genres":[{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":34,"name":"Visual Novel"}],"name":"July","platforms":[{"id":23,"name":"Dreamcast"}],"release_dates":[{"id":320999,"human":"1998","region":5}],"screenshots":[{"id":377638,"image_id":"sc83dy"},{"id":377639,"image_id":"sc83dz"},{"id":377640,"image_id":"sc83e0"}],"summary":"An adventure game that follows two Japanese kids as they try to solve a mysterious bombing attack."},{"id":209905,"cover":{"id":232817,"image_id":"co4zn5"},"name":"Professor Iris' Fun Field Trip: Animal Safari","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"release_dates":[{"id":373905,"human":"TBD","region":8}]},{"id":40911,"cover":{"id":356648,"image_id":"co7n6w"},"name":"Steamroller","platforms":[{"id":68,"name":"ColecoVision"}],"release_dates":[{"id":555122,"human":"Jul 29, 2000","region":8}],"summary":"Repair the potholes in the road.

The objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest possible score by following specific rules of play. There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature. Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question, which is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (four-way match).\n\nThe Sega Genesis/Mega Drive port was infamously at the center of the Sega v. Accolade trial of October 31, 1991, Sega filed suit against Accolade in the United States District Court on charges of trademark infringement and unfair competition. Sega argued that Accolade had infringed upon its copyrights because Accolade's games contained Sega's material through reverse engineering of Sega's tech in order to avoid paying license fees. Ultimately, Accolade was ruled in violation on April 3, 1992, when Judge Caulfield ruled in favor of Sega and issued an injunction prohibiting future sales by Accolade of Genesis-compatible games incorporating the Sega message or using the results of the reverse engineering. Almost a week later, Accolade was also required by the court to recall all of their Genesis-compatible games."},{"id":185155,"name":"Mage March","screenshots":[{"id":700847,"image_id":"scf0rz"},{"id":700848,"image_id":"scf0s0"}],"summary":"A rhythm game for an unusual audience."},{"id":97615,"name":"Pachitte Chonmage Tatsujin 2: CR Jurassic Park"},{"id":176238,"name":"Feed of Comfort","screenshots":[{"id":662941,"image_id":"sce7j1"},{"id":662944,"image_id":"sce7j4"},{"id":662946,"image_id":"sce7j6"},{"id":662949,"image_id":"sce7j9"}],"summary":"Short interactive story on indifference, inertia and hopelessness #ResistJam"},{"id":96581,"name":"Helping Frankenstein"},{"id":168721,"cover":{"id":183779,"image_id":"co3xsz"},"genres":[{"id":4,"name":"Fighting"}],"name":"SoulCalibur VI: Tira","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"release_dates":[{"id":316411,"human":"Oct 19, 2018","region":2},{"id":320823,"human":"Oct 19, 2018","region":2},{"id":320826,"human":"Oct 19, 2018","region":2}],"screenshots":[{"id":616054,"image_id":"scd7cm"},{"id":616055,"image_id":"scd7cn"},{"id":616061,"image_id":"scd7ct"}],"summary":"Access to the playable character Tira in the full retail version of SOULCALIBUR VI.

In the span of two generations the town was built up to the status of prestige it now commands, an expansion helmed by the Hadou Group, an industrial complex and family dynasty currently run by the young Hadou Ruri. She pursues the peace and prosperity of Arkham diligently, against the forces of darkness threatening to plunge the city, and the world, back into a second dark age. Among the most sinister threats to Arkham City is the evil Black Lodge syndicate. Led by the charismatic Master Therion, his nihilistic outlook shapes the group's destructive goals: with a circle of powerful sorcerers at his command, the potential for sowing chaos in the city is unmatched.\n\nFormer Miskatonic University Magic Academy student Daijuuji Kurou knows little of grimoires, but what he does know terrifies him - enough that he left his university life behind, and now practices a failing detective business in the shelter of an orphanage in a quiet corner of Arkham. But just when he thought his Academy past was buried, it catches up with him and pulls him back into the dark shadows of the occult: Hadou Ruri herself appears at his door with an offer he can't refuse. The only way to combat the Black Lodge's growing magical power is to find, and retrieve, a grimoire with the power to activate the mightiest Machina of all: Demonbane.

In both games, the Taxing rank is locked until the player completes Tricky.\n\nWhile the game has a couple unique, albeit forgettable, levels, the vast majority of its levels are either taken directly from the later ranks of Lemmings (the J2ME version only had levels from the original Fun rank) or taken from Oh No! More Lemmings but reskinned with original Lemmings tilesets, much like the Mega Drive version of the original game, with most of them here taken from the Tame rank.","collections":[{"id":1118,"games":[{"id":4239,"cover":{"id":100880,"image_id":"co25u8"},"first_release_date":666489600,"name":"Lemmings"},{"id":7663,"cover":{"id":88194,"image_id":"co1w1u"},"first_release_date":846720000,"name":"The Adventures of Lomax"},{"id":8307,"cover":{"id":115955,"image_id":"co2hgz"},"first_release_date":757296000,"name":"Lemmings 2: The Tribes"},{"id":10127,"cover":{"id":192316,"image_id":"co44e4"},"first_release_date":956880000,"name":"Lemmings Revolution"},{"id":13779,"cover":{"id":290066,"image_id":"co67te"},"first_release_date":812332800,"name":"Lemmings 3D"},{"id":13780,"cover":{"id":233694,"image_id":"co50bi"},"first_release_date":833500800,"name":"Lemmings Paintball"},{"id":14246,"cover":{"id":378135,"image_id":"co83rr"},"first_release_date":788832000,"name":"All New World of Lemmings"},{"id":14481,"cover":{"id":378121,"image_id":"co83rd"},"first_release_date":694137600,"name":"Oh No!

Similarly to its predecessor, it's an action-strategy game where the player must manage his funds and personally prepare all the dishes for the customers.\n\nBefore the start of each day, the player can spend money to purchase expansions for his restaurant, including new food menu items and proper equipment. Once the day starts, the player must manage his time carefully to cater to all the customers and the restaurant's needs from morning till closing hours.\n\nThroughout the day, new customers keep coming in and ordering food, and events (such as the need to wash dishes or a fire in the kitchen) require the manager's attention. Each customer and event is represented by a gradually vanishing bar. Preparing food and caring for problems is usually done through a simple, action minigame. The player can only take on one of these at a time, but it is possible to serve prepared meals to customers in the middle of something else.\n\nEach customer expects his food to be prepared strictly according to order. If the player messes something up by adding the wrong ingredients or by under- or overcooking the food, the customer will pay less. And if a customer waits too long without their order being attended to, they get furious and leave, causing a minor monetary penalty. Things get even more hectic during the \"Rush Hour\" that comes twice daily, during which large crowds of customers keep coming in.\n\nOre no Ryomi 2 also contains several \"Challenges\": the player, invited to the Iron Chef TV show, tries to complete a specific difficult task, such as preparing many perfect dishes in a limited time.

Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the Bemani series, and released in North America and Europe in 1999, Dance Dance Revolution is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance genre in video games. Players stand on a \"dance platform\" or stage and hit colored arrows laid out in a cross with their feet to musical and visual cues. Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score.\n\nDance Dance Revolution has been given much critical acclaim for its originality and stamina in the video game market. There have been dozens of arcade-based releases across several countries and hundreds of home video game console releases, promoting a music library of original songs produced by Konami's in-house artists and an eclectic set of licensed music from many different genres. The DDR series has inspired similar games such as Pump It Up by Andamiro and In the Groove by Roxor","collections":[{"id":602,"games":[{"id":3467,"cover":{"id":111400,"image_id":"co2dyg"},"first_release_date":975542400,"name":"Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Dancing

However, Wally, the spirit of the mountain, was mad at the Demon for creating his dungeon lair inside his home. He tells No-Knees he would assist her in escaping as long as she helped him to defeat the demon and allows her to use his power of portal creation.","summary":"Narbacular Drop is an environmental puzzle video game developed by Nuclear Monkey Software. It was released for free online in 2005 for Microsoft Windows. It was the senior game project of students attending DigiPen Institute of Technology. The gameplay consists of navigating a dungeon using an innovative portal system. The player controls a pair of interconnected portals that can be placed on any non-metallic surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). Gabe Newell, managing director of Valve Corporation, took interest in the team's work and employed the whole staff at Valve. The developers went on to make Portal (2007) using many of the same concepts.\n\nThe word Narbacular, which does not exist in any dictionary, was chosen primarily to aid in internet search engine results.\n\nBeing mostly a proof of applied concept, the game contains only six puzzles to solve. However, members of the Narbacular Drop forum community have created a catalog of custom maps."},{"id":99843,"name":"Operation Minerva"},{"id":207413,"cover":{"id":261615,"image_id":"co5lv3"},"genres":[{"id":13,"name":"Simulator"},{"id":15,"name":"Strategy"},{"id":32,"name":"Indie"}],"name":"Ragamuffins: Feline Fencers","screenshots":[{"id":824991,"image_id":"schokf"},{"id":824992,"image_id":"schokg"},{"id":824993,"image_id":"schokh"},{"id":824995,"image_id":"schokj"},{"id":824996,"image_id":"schokk"},{"id":824998,"image_id":"schokm"},{"id":824999,"image_id":"schokn"},{"id":825001,"image_id":"schokp"}],"summary":"Unique item shop meets card battle game...with cats...with hats"},{"id":66394,"cover":{"id":47704,"image_id":"gt9sslzvrubxwmdnxeve"},"name":"Psycho Santa","summary":"Freebie game included on a demo disk in the January 1993 issue of \"The One\" Amiga magazine."},{"id":109211,"name":"Astroball"},{"id":106361,"genres":[{"id":13,"name":"Simulator"}],"name":"Cookie Baker","summary":"Get in your very own kitchen, it's time to bake some cookies!\nMix many kinds of ingredients and bake according to the chef's recommended recipe book."},{"id":56429,"cover":{"id":31820,"image_id":"pwlndhqbkfg0zdjbdjyf"},"name":"Flatdog","summary":"Flatdog"},{"id":92564,"name":"CataclysmRL"},{"id":243941,"cover":{"id":378129,"image_id":"co83rl"},"genres":[{"id":9,"name":"Puzzle"},{"id":15,"name":"Strategy"}],"name":"Lemmings 2: The Tribes","platforms":[{"id":29,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"}],"release_dates":[{"id":465768,"human":"1994","region":2},{"id":465769,"human":"1994","region":1}],"screenshots":[{"id":1023117,"image_id":"sclxfx"},{"id":1023118,"image_id":"sclxfy"},{"id":1023119,"image_id":"sclxfz"},{"id":1023120,"image_id":"sclxg0"},{"id":1023121,"image_id":"sclxg1"},{"id":1023122,"image_id":"sclxg2"},{"id":1023123,"image_id":"sclxg3"}],"summary":"This port of Lemmings 2 sees the graphics stay mostly the same, with only some slight downgrades in quality and performance due to the less powerful hardware.

These can be laptops, desktops, or Android devices. \nOne big screen (large monitor, TV, or projector). \nA stable network. Wifi can work, but we recommend a wired LAN. \nIf playing over the internet, voice chat is strongly recommended. \nAll but 1 of the officers operate \"stations\" that control different parts of the ship. The last computer is for the main screen, which does not need any input and should be visible to all players. \n \nDesignate 1 player as Captain, whose computer can serve as the ship's main screen. The Captain's only duty is to communicate with the other officers and tell them what they should do. \n \nThe other officers each operate one of the ship's stations, which are described in the Stations tab. \n \nRunning the game \nAfter starting the game on the computer serving as the main screen, you can also configure it as the game server. The other stations can then connect to the game server as clients. \n \nAfter starting the server, select a scenario (we recommend the \"Waves\" or \"Basic\" scenarios for first games), then spawn a player ship for everyone to join. \n \nEveryone should select the same ship and choose their designated station. That's it! You're now in command of a fully functional spaceship. \n \nInternet play \nA crew can play EmptyEpsilon over internet connections. This means the game server needs to be accessible from the internet. The server runs on port 35666, which needs to be open in your firewall and forwarded to your server if you are behind a router.","summary":"What is it? \nEmptyEpsilon is a spaceship bridge simulator game. It's fully open source, so it can be modified in any way people wish. \n \nWhat does this mean? \nEmptyEpsilon places you in the roles of a spaceship's bridge officers, like those seen in Star Trek. While you can play EmptyEpsilon alone or with friends, the best experience involves 6 players working together on each ship. \n \nEach officer fills a unique role: Captain, Helms, Weapons, Relay, Science, and Engineering. Except for the Captain, each officer operates part of the ship through a specialized screen. The Captain relies on their trusty crew to report information and follow orders. \n \nLike Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator? \nArtemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator was the inspiration for EmptyEpsilon. It's pretty good as a bridge simulator, but we had some issues with it that we wanted to fix. Since Artemis isn't open source, our only solution was to start over by ourselves. \n \nFor example, the \"comms\" station of Artemis is pretty limited and can be boring for the player. The game could fall out of sync, confusing the players. Also, its Game Master screen didn't do everything that we wanted. \n \nAll in all, Artemis is a nice game. We wrote our own to be able to implement new features and extensibility."},{"id":72772,"cover":{"id":56080,"image_id":"maxmxzzg9pihhoaihk3n"},"genres":[{"id":12,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)"}],"name":"Holic Online","summary":"Holic is a cute-style MMORPG developed by the well-known online game developer Mgame based in Seoul, South Korea.

The purpose of the game is to manage the flights that are presented to the player without the flights being delayed or exiting/landing in the wrong location. The aircraft either come flying in on the screen and have preset exit or landing points or show up as wanting to take off with an exit point. It is the player's job to determine the route each aircraft flies and when they may land or take off.\n\nThe aircraft cannot be too close to each other, so the player needs to make sure that they are passing each other on different flight levels or with sufficient distance (three grid dots north/south or east/west) between them. When an aircraft is in danger of crashing or is exiting at the wrong location or altitude, the aircraft will inform the air traffic controller. Aircraft do not change course/altitude unless the player tells them to. Incoming aircraft not given clearance to land, however, will go into a holding pattern and wait until given clearance. When necessary, the player can also give holding instructions to aircraft, as long as their course takes them over a VOR tower which is used as the holding fix.\n\nTo start with, there are few flights at the same time, but at higher GS levels, there are many flights that need management at the same time. Also storms which the aircraft can not pass through show up and some aircraft have very little fuel and have to land fast or they will crash."},{"id":42403,"cover":{"id":120551,"image_id":"co2l0n"},"genres":[{"id":25,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"}],"name":"The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes","platforms":[{"id":58,"name":"Super Famicom"}],"release_dates":[{"id":542758,"human":"Mar 17, 1995","region":5}],"screenshots":[{"id":409664,"image_id":"sc8s3k"},{"id":409665,"image_id":"sc8s3l"},{"id":409666,"image_id":"sc8s3m"}],"summary":"The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes is an action game released in 1995 for the Super Famicom, showcasing the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man.

She reverts to being an assassin once she leaves her home but seems to find displeasure in her profession.\n\nOther new additions to the game include Ash Crimson, Blue Mary and Makoto Mizoguchi from Fighter's History series.","collections":[{"id":6388,"games":[{"id":15435,"cover":{"id":269521,"image_id":"co5ryp"},"first_release_date":1146096000,"name":"The King of Fighters 2006"},{"id":86164,"cover":{"id":175946,"image_id":"co3rre"},"first_release_date":1215388800,"name":"The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact Regulation A"}]}]},{"id":97508,"name":"Lutte"},{"id":97522,"name":"Puppis & Choler"},{"id":104666,"name":"Knife Flip - Hit Geometry Cube"},{"id":104423,"name":"Ztarlings"},{"id":105784,"name":"Candy Legend"},{"id":266656,"name":"Mini-Vaders","platforms":[{"id":52,"name":"Arcade"}],"release_dates":[{"id":516042,"human":"Q1 1992","region":5}],"summary":"Taito game spin-off of Space Invaders."},{"id":266670,"name":"Blank Blood","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"release_dates":[{"id":516062,"human":"TBD","region":8}],"summary":"Exploratory platform game of ryona style."},{"id":266673,"name":"Rayer Shoot","platforms":[{"id":121,"name":"Sharp X68000"}],"release_dates":[{"id":516065,"human":"TBD","region":8}],"summary":"Vertical scrolling shooter."},{"id":266680,"name":"Pinball Champ '95","platforms":[{"id":52,"name":"Arcade"}],"release_dates":[{"id":516078,"human":"TBD","region":8}],"summary":"Pinball gambling game."},{"id":74809,"cover":{"id":43678,"image_id":"hveuzkdle4vziyftcjlt"},"name":"Spooky Spotlight","platforms":[{"id":82,"name":"Web browser"}],"release_dates":[{"id":124773,"human":"Oct 09, 2017","region":2}],"summary":"A simple Halloween themed Pokémon browser game where you aim a flashlight at Pokémon and candy while trying to avoid ghost type Pokémon."},{"id":97702,"name":"Shoujo Houkai: Oniichan no Catharsis"},{"id":49903,"cover":{"id":133770,"image_id":"co2v7u"},"genres":[{"id":14,"name":"Sport"}],"name":"NBA Jam 2001","platforms":[{"id":22,"name":"Game Boy Color"}],"release_dates":[{"id":96425,"human":"Jan 01, 2001","region":8}],"summary":"Get even more arcade-style basketball action with NBA JAM 2001.

They also often come together, especially for heists, a complex type of mission where a large operation needs to be planned and executed by determining a strategy and hiring additional henchmen. As with previous games in the series, the gameplay involves gunfights and takes place in a sprawling, open-world city where players get around by acquiring transport (cars, boats, helicopters, etc) through less than legal means. Players can roam the game world, complete story missions, and partake in various illegal activities, including shooting civilians, robbing people, destruction of cars, and the titular act of car theft. These lead to a wanted rating of up to five stars, sending in a police force in pursuit. Continuing to resist the police will also increase it.

His spaceship was both his home and the manifestation of freedom to Jack. In the prologue of our story this most precious thing was taken from him by force.

Once he had fulfilled his part of the deal, the treacherous employer shot Jack in the back and dumped him from the ramp of his \"Beth\" like a sack of trash. Now Jack is stranded on K'Tharsis and wants “his flying baby” back. Bullets will be shot, teeth cracked and God knows what will happen, because Jack has become angrier and greedier than ever.","summary":"Exoplanet: First Contact is a single-player, story driven action-RPG set in a space western universe, where real and fictional technologies meet the cruel and unforgiving, yet romantic reality of the Wild West exploration and development.
