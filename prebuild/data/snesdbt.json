The story mode involves buying new cars, customizing them with parts, and winning races to earn money and gain access to better vehicles.

The gameplay is similar to that of Aero the Acrobat games, involving fast-paced side-scrolling and platforming action. Zero can eliminate his enemies by executing his trademark Kamikaze Slam: spinning in the air and crushing the unlucky adversary. He can also collect shurikens (shooting stars) scattered across the levels, and use them for projectile attacks. The squirrel is able to perform double jumps to reach high platforms and jump over larger chasms."],

Zan III is also the second in the Zan series to be released on the Super Famicom: most of the Zan series only appeared on Japanese home computers like the PC-9801 and FM Towns. The player is once again asked to lead the armies of their chosen daimyo (warlord) in an effort to conquer the rest of 16th century Japan.\n\nZan III Spirits is an adaptation of Zan III: Tenun Ware ni Ari for the PC-9801, which was originally released in December 1993 four months prior. Zan III Spirits, like its SFC predecessor Zan II Spirits, was modified for its console release to make it work with the limitations/strengths of the system."],

The game is a series of set-piece battles where two opponents build up gauges using the D-pad and one of the face buttons: each combination leads to a separate attack and requires a different amount of build-up. The player can go through the story mode, which recounts events from the manga, or they can play a \"free\" mode against opponents of their choice.\n\nThough they have identical names, this particular Yu Yu Hakusho is not to be confused with the 1993 Game Boy Yu Yu Hakusho game, nor the 1994 3DO Yu Yu Hakusho game."],

The game tells the story of a boy who dreams of the mysterious kingdom of Enderia every night. There, he constantly lives exciting adventures and this time he is on a quest to save this world from destruction. Our hero must explore perilous towers and rescue all the kidnapped princesses from the kingdom. He is, however, not alone and friends (Harumi and Zakkari) will later help him out in his journey. Interestingly, the boy doesn't level up but wears special animal costumes called Kigurumi. Each new costume gives the player a certain number of characteristics and abilities such as better attacks or special magic spells. Some enemies (such as giant sparrows chicken or cows) must be defeated in order to acquire their costumes and abilities. Changing Rooms are scattered throughout the game and allow the boy to equip Kigurumis and Tailors can store them and customize their abilities if needed. Yume Meikyu Kigurumi Daiboken is a classical dungeon crawler but it however features a random and turned based battle system. Our heroes can punch, kick or use special attacks and a grid displayed over the combat screen allows the player to precisely hit his enemies and, in some cases, even find their weak spots. Once the combat is over, the player is awarded with candies than can be used to purchase new items or be eaten to recover some health."],

  "Description": ["This is the sequel to Mario’s Strange Quest. Picking up where Mario’s Strange Quest left off, it turns out that the part where Yoshi’s eggs hatched at the end of MSQ didn’t actually happen. What really happened after Mario beat Bowser, rescued Yoshi’s eggs, and saved the princess was that Yoshi and his sleepy friend decided to move to a new land so that he can protect his eggs from Bowser before they really hatched. So, both Yoshis do so and they find themselves in the land of Weirdonia. However, it seems that Bowser apparently insists on stealing Yoshi’s eggs, since Yoshi’s eggs were stolen again while Yoshi was out shopping. Since Mario isn’t around to help this time, Yoshi goes on a quest by himself to retrieve his eggs. However, just like Mario’s Strange Quest, this isn’t your ordinary quest. The land of Weirdonia is a strange land filled with bizarre gimmicks, weird themes, and possibly jelly filled donuts and pizza. Expect the unexpected during Yoshi’s journey.\n\nThis hack’s features:\n-71 levels (100 exits)\n-Custom Graphics\n-Tested on and works on a real SNES\n-Custom Music\n-Custom ASM\n-Lots of level variety\n-Plenty of (possibly) unique gimmicks and themes\n-Lots of silliness and general weirdness\n-A box art image, a cartridge sticker image, and a game manual (download links are in the readme)\n-Older versions of YSQ (V1.0, V1.1, V1.2, and V1.3 Beta) are linked to in the readme for those that are interested in seeing what YSQ was like in past versions\n-Lots of secrets to find\n-Free novelty T-shirts with every download* \n\n*T-shirt not included"],

It's also been graphically updated. It is still superficially similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series of strategy sims."],

The name simply means \"Yokoyama Mitsuteru's version of Sangokushi\", Sangokushi being the Japanese name for the Chinese literary classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The manga and anime retell the story of the book, with the game focused on this retelling.\n\nDuring the game's development the anime adaptation was in full swing, so the game was intended to be a companion piece. This was a standard practice of Bandai at the time (Angel was a game publisher subsidiary of the toy giant), as was hiring freelance developers like TOSE to develop for them.\n\nThe game is a standard turn-based strategy war sim in the vein of Koei's much more prolific Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. The player and the AI-controlled rival kingdoms select actions that include diplomacy, combat and domestic matters such as farming and trade, with the ultimate goal being to wrest control over the rest of China from the other two kingdoms.\n\nThe game was followed up with two sequels: a standard sequel in Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi II and the board game spin-off Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi Bangi."],

Special moves are quite similar to those found in Street Fighter II (Wolverine has a Dragon-Punch-style attack and Gambit's Double Kick is virtually identical to M. Bison's Scissors Kick) and require similar button combinations.\n\nWhile most stages are unique for each character, some can be played with any of the X-Men. Progress is saved via password."],

  "Description": ["XBAND was one of the first competitive online console gaming networks and was available for the Genesis and Super NES systems. It was produced by Catapult Entertainment, a Cupertino, California-based software company. It is the only modem released in America to have been officially licensed by Nintendo. It debuted in various areas of the United States in late 1994 and 1995.\n\nHistory:\n\nThe Genesis version of the XBAND was released in November 1994, with the Super NES version following in June 1995, and the Super Famicom version in April 1996. The Genesis version also works with the Genesis Nomad. In Brazil the Mega Drive service was released as the Mega Net 2, named after the Sega Meganet.\n\nIn 1995, Catapult Entertainment signed a deal with General Instrument, producers of the Sega Channel, which stipulated that the XBAND modem would henceforth be built into new Sega Channel adapters, and that the top 5 to 10 games offered by Sega Channel each month would be wired for play over XBAND.\n\nInitially, Catapult Entertainment had a limited staff and virtually no advertising. By January 1997, XBAND network playability had reached practically every metropolitan area and several rural areas in the U.S. The actual XBAND modems were carried by a handful of software and video rental chains across the United States. Internationally, the XBAND saw some limited expansion in the Japanese market, and Catapult was working on PC- and Sega Saturn-based versions of the platform, though they merged with Mpath Interactive, and the focus shifted to the online PC gaming service, Mplayer.com (Mplayer.com was taken offline and integrated into GameSpy Arcade in 2001, after acquired by GameSpy on December 2000).\n\nService:\n\nThe concept of playing online was fairly new at the time. Arcades were still quite popular, and online gaming was not yet a household idea.\n\nThe XBAND modem was widely available at Blockbuster Video branches during its time. It retailed for $19.99, with additional charges based on usage. Two pricing plans were available. One had a monthly fee of $4.95 and allowed the user to connect to the service up to 50 times a month with each additional connection costing 15 cents. The other had a monthly fee of $9.95 and granted the subscriber an unlimited number of connections per month. Activities that consumed a player's monthly allowance of connections included dialing into the XBAND service for matchmaking, downloading mail (called \"XMAIL\"), and downloading the daily edition of the two XBAND newsletters, one containing generic news and the other containing platform-specific information such as leaderboards and contest announcements. Players were also assessed a fee of $3.95/hour for connecting to opponents outside their local calling area; player-to-player connections inside their local calling area were free.\n\nThe modem features built-in storage for up to four users (\"codenames\"). It stores user friend lists, which can contain the codenames of up to ten of the user's friends; the users' XMAIL boxes, storing up to ten incoming and ten outgoing messages for each user; the users' rankings, win/loss records, and accumulated scores; a short profile section; and the user's avatar (chosen from 40 preset avatars). Text entry is done either through an on-screen keyboard or an optional XBAND keyboard add-on ($29.95 MSRP) released later in the network's lifespan.\n\nThe client-side system worked by manipulating the game's memory in a way similar to Game Genie and third-party computer game modifications such as Multi Theft Auto.\n\nA problem of most online services of the time was that the connection would be lost whenever a phone on the same line was picked up. The XBand operating system was designed to ensure that connections are not lost due to phone activity; in the case of call waiting, the system would alert the user to the call and allow the game to be resumed.\n\nXBAND had an official website where a member could check any other player's statistics, along with other information and updates that were not available to view on consoles.\n\nAt its height, XBAND had 15,000 subscribed members.\n\nGaming:\n\nA 1995 article in Next Generation stated that the XBAND modem's \"ultra-low latency is the key to its successful handling of realtime videogaming\". The modem's data transfer rate was 2,400 bits per second, which, while low compared to PC modems of the time, was sufficient to handle the simple one-on-one games which XBAND was used with.\n\nWhen connecting to play, unless a player specified a particular user from their friend list, players would be matched with a random player elsewhere in the country (or the player's local area code depending on their preference settings) who was also connecting to play the same game. The server would attempt to match players of like skill levels, using the Elo rating system. When the network matched two players up, the newly-connected player's XBAND modem would disconnect from the server and dial the other player, whose own XBAND modem would answer when the phone rang. At that point the players would see the XBAND logo slide together, followed by the matchup screen, which displayed each player's codenames, avatars, locations, and a pre-typed \"taunt\".\n\nIn December 1995 XBAND launched its first national tournament. This was the first modem to modem tournament ever to be held over a console. The grand prize winner received a special Genghis Khan icon for their XBAND profile and a $200 cash prize from Catapult. Peter Kappes aka \"SphiNX\" of Orlando, FL became the first person in history to win a modem to modem national tournament over a console."],

His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!\n\nIn this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own \"experiments\" with them.

  "Description": ["It is said the the Cosmic Forge is a magical pen possessing an enormous power: whatever is written with it instantly becomes true. A group of explorers ventures into the castle that where the king, the queen, and the wizard who created the pen used to dwell. Nobody knows what has been happening there for the last hundred years, since nobody dares to enter the haunted castle. As the heroes step in, the doors behind them close forever. They are left alone to discover the truth about the Cosmic Forge and the drama that occurred between the castle's inhabitants.\n\nBane of the Cosmic Forge is the sixth entry in the Wizardry series. While retaining the basic premise of creating a party of up to six adventurers to roam first-person dungeons and fight enemies in turn-based combat, this installment contains numerous enhancements and new features. It is the first game in the series to feature full color graphics and a mouse-driven interface. Combat options are more detailed, with precise weapon moves (such as thrust and bash) available. Magic is divided into six different schools, the spellcaster's powers increasing if he or she concentrates on one of them. Picking locks or disarming traps by thief-like classes is done actively by participating in a simple minigame. Characters can learn skills unique to their class when leveling up. These skills range from weapon proficiencies to field abilities that can be used outside of combat.\n\nIn addition to the traditional races of humans, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and gnomes, the player can choose between the Lizardman, the cat-like Felpurr, the canine Rawulf, the pixie-like Faerie, the intimidating Dracon, and the furry Mook. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as predispositions to certain classes. Exotic character classes such as Valkyrie, Alchemist, Psionic, Ninja, Samurai, and Monk are also available during character creation, though they require a higher amount of bonus points received during the initial dice roll. It is also possible for characters to switch to another class during the course of the game."],

  "Description": ["Wizardry Gaiden IV: Taima no Kodou (\"Throb of the Demon's Heart\") is a turn-based dungeon crawler RPG for the Super Famicom. It is the fourth in a series of \"gaiden\" Wizardry games developed by Japanese studio Access and influenced heavily by Sir-Tech's core Wizardry series. The game was fan translated in late 2016.\n\nThrob of the Demon's Heart is distinctive for the Wizardry series for adapting a lot of Japanese imagery and monsters in the familiar Wizardry format. This gives it a more home-grown feel among the Japanese-exclusive spin-offs, and heavily draws from Japanese folklore and religion.\n\nIt is the first Wizardry Gaiden to be released on a system other than the Nintendo Game Boy, and is also the last in the series. Many more Japanese Wizardry spin-off games would follow, however."],

  "Description": ["The Confederation have been at war with the Kilrathi for the past 20 years, and you're just now joining the Vega campaign. You're a 2nd Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good work under your belt. You're posted to Tiger's Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet. Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go down in infamy?\n\nWing Commander is a space combat simulator interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part.\n\nThe 3D space combat has you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You'll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces.\n\nWhen the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree has both winning and losing paths."],

Years later, survivors of this disaster live on boats or man-made islands called Atolls.  Everyone in this new world is looking for a mythical place called Dry Land, which people believe that there is a map to Dry Land on a little girl's back named Enola.  A band of pirates who live an oil tanker called the Smokers are after Dry Land and they are trying to get Enola for the tatoo on her back.  A nameless drifter who has adapted to the new world and this causes him to have gills and webbed feet, gets involved in this whole \"quest for Dry Land\" so to speak and becomes responsible for Enola and the woman who looks after her named Helen.\n\nYou play as the nameless drifter only known as The Marnier.  You play through three types of gameplay.  The first type of gameplay involves you sailing in a some-what big area and clearing the area of Smokers. There is a second type of these sailing levels add something else.  You can save the Atollers from The Smokers.  The second type of gameplay is the swimming.  You swim underwater avoiding sea creatures and collecting items for money to use at the shop after you kill off Smokers on the Atolls.  Killing of The Smokers is the third type of gameplay. You run through the Atolls with your big knife at first and then you get three more weapons along the way which are a pistol, a speargun, and a machine gun."],

It aired from 1982-2014 and made several longevity records in the process.\n\nThe game allows for up to four players, but only two players ever play at once: most of the mini-games are based on completing a task within a set time or with a certain amount of precision, so all players don't need to play simultaneously. Instead, the first pair of players will play each mini-game, followed by the second pair (or two-and-one, if the three-player mode was selected). These mini-games have a comedic edge to them and vary from bowling with a snooker cue to a Simon Says game that involves clapping the correct way to certain goofy poses Tamori makes."],

The game is set in the near future of 2028, and involves a pair of brothers who enter a theme park based on Jules Verne and end up trapped there. While looking for a way out and avoiding the various hostile robots that populate the park, the brothers find other human guests and also friendly animatronic robots that join the party. The park's exhibits and rides are all based on Verne's novels, such as Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and Around the World in Eighty Days.\n\nVarious gameplay changes are present to account for the fact that the player is in a theme park rather than a fantasy setting. Instead of resting at inns, for example, the party eats at various restaurants and vending machines across the park. Weapons tend to include baseball bats and other found goods."],

  "Description": ["Ushio to Tora (\"Ushio and Tora\") is a game based on the manga of the same name. It features Ushio Aotsuki, a young man who discovers the powerful Beast Spear that his ancestor used to trap a vicious youkai monster called Tora (Japanese for \"tiger\"). Recovering the spear causes not only Tora to be free, but draws many other evil youkai out from hiding. Tora works begrudgingly with Ushio to fight back the wave of youkai out of fear of the spear's power (though as the manga progresses, Tora's reasons for helping become more altruistic).\n\nThe game is a side-scrolling brawler with short stages that culminate in boss fights with other youkai, similar to the Super Famicom GeGeGe no Kitarou game. The player can choose between Ushio and Tora to control, and each controls slightly differently: Ushio has greater range with the spear and can create shockwaves, while Tora is a powerhouse up close with his claws and can summon bolts of lightning."],

  "Description": ["There is not a whole lot to say about this game. It appears to be a one track demo of a top-down racing game, presumably by Virgin Games. There is a two player split-screen mode already implemented. The controls are smooth, and the music and sound effects are solid. The graphics are ok, but the cars are really squished. As far as I can tell, no finished game ever came from this. There are some fragments of Super Bomberman in the ROM image, which was likely burned onto the EPROMs prior to this demo."],

  "Description": ["Universal Soldier was in development by The Code Monkeys and was to be published by Accolade. The game was actually a sequel to the Manfred Trentz game, Turrican, but the character sprite was changed so that it could be rebranded as a movie tie-in. A rom of what appears to be the complete version of this game exists. The enemies and gameplay closely match Turrican, as to be expected. It is unknown why this game was canceled. Genesis and Game Boy versions of this game were released, and Turrican 2 was released on various computer platforms. Nintendo Power commented in the October 1992 issue that it was similar to Contra, but complained about the poor controls.\n\nThe game was originally developed using the original C64 source code and Amiga graphics as a base. At a late stage in the development, Accolade also acquired rights to produce a game spin-off of the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Universal Soldier and decided to re-brand the game as Universal Soldier. Turrican's sprite was changed into a marine and several other substitutions were made. Amongst other changes, the eyeballs-walking-on-fingers became mini tanks, and instead of a large mech/steel dragon in the first stage, the player now faces a large representation of Dolph Lundgren's character in the film.\n\nThe three shoot 'em up stages, cut out from the port, were replaced by the developers with three original stages (a Vietnam jungle, a fortress, and a motel/car junkyard) that in theory should link the game to the film's atmosphere. The rest of the original Turrican II stages are still present and remain mostly intact in overall design, though some of them appear in different order, along with the three new levels differently scattered through them."],

The game centers around a large playing field composed of a random arrangement of Mario heads, Coins, Yoshi Eggs, Fire Flowers, and Super Mushrooms. If two or more icons are connected, the player can move the cursor and click to make all the connected icons disappear. Now the icons above fall down and the player can clear even more icons. Also, there is an undo move that allows the player to take back the last move, and move back as far as wanted. Once the entire grid is clear, the game ends. Like Mario & Wario, the game was only released in Japan, but is entirely in English."],

As with other games in the series, the player can choose between multiple members of the same family as their protagonist, each of which has their own reason for fishing. It saw sequels for the Game Boy (Umi no Nushi Tsuri 2) and the PlayStation (Umi no Nushi Tsuri: Takarajima he Mukatte)."],

The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies.

His headquarters is in a secret room at the top of the great Tower, which is guarded by more than six enemies with psychotic fighting skills. Many great warriors have entered the Tower to overthrow the Fighting King, but none have come back.\n\nFinally, four brave champions have traveled from distant lands. Each is a powerful warrior, with the strength and determination to end the reign of terror and restore peace to the land.

The goal of the game is to compete with a series of characters from Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai depending on who the player selected.\n\nPlay involves stacking duos of faces of various colors. If the player completes a set of three faces - they don't have to be lined up, but they do need to be adjacent - the faces disappear. If they are next to a \"trapped\" face it is transformed into a normal face block. Ideally, the player completes a three-strong stack of identical-colored trapped faces and frees them in groups of three, which will then lead to a chain as those three vanish and free more trapped faces."],

  "Genres": "Role-Playing",
  "Description": ["The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.\n\nSion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.\nSurlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins\nRiza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.\n\nRudra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.\n\nThe game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable \"Ig\" represents fire and the syllable \"ga\" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore \"Igga\" is a more powerful version than \"Ig\" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople."],

Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.\n\nTreasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down \"town\" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.\n\nEnemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs)."],

The game has a comedic angle and features expressive characters designed by Tamakichi Sakura. It was followed by a PlayStation sequel, Tower Dream 2, in 1998.\n\nThe game features a number of \"worlds\" the player can try out, each with different board configurations and themes. The themes run from the mundane, like Tokyo or Hong Kong, to the fantastical, like prehistoric, horror movies or space.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe goal of the game is to move around a board which encircles a giant grid. The player can buy property on any square on the grid that is parallel to the space they're on, increasing the rent value of that space. When other players land on the same space, they pay the controlling player(s) a specific amount of rent a la Monopoly. With some smart planning, the player can purchase many properties along the same row or column and boost their rent prices higher and higher. Building properties on adjacent spaces on the grid also creates corporations, which generate more cash and can absorb smaller companies alongside them. Corner spaces on the outer ring lead to slot machine mini-games that can earn players a bit of extra cash."],

Certain results occur depending on where Lucky Man ends his turn, from gaining bonus items to talking to NPCs to a combat situation. Combat plays out like a turn-based RPG, and Lucky Man with his fellow heroes Shouriman (Victory Man) and Yuujouman (Friend Man) fight against various unusual enemies. The goal of the game is to rescue Lucky Man's love interest Mit-chan from a mysterious kidnapper."],

Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a \"Mysterious Dungeon\", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.\n\nTorneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a \"dungeon crawl\". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected.

  "Description": ["Toride (\"Fortress\", sometimes referred to as Pai Toride or \"Mahjong Tile Fortress\") is a mahjong solitaire game released exclusively in Japan first in the Arcade and subsequently on the Super Famicom in 1994.\n\nThe player must clear all the tiles on the screen, as per usual mahjong solitaire rules, but in order to do so they have to store matching tiles along the bottom of the screen. The player's \"hand\" has a limited number of slots available, and if the player fills it up with pieces that don't match then they have failed. There is also a timer for the whole round that ticks down whenever the player is deliberating on their next move, and removing pairs of pieces from play will slightly refill it. There are also special power-up tiles that increase the timer.\n\nAs with mahjong solitaire, the player can only match identical tiles. The exception are the eight unique season and flower tiles, which can be paired off with any other season or flower (though it has to be two seasons or two flowers)."],

The goal of the game is to grow the player character's nascent corporation to be one of the largest and most profitable in the world with savvy business practice. Possibly due to the large amount of text and Japan-centric business terminology, the game was never released outside of Japan.\n\nThe PC-9801 version is considerably denser than the other two versions, featuring many additional features to create a closer proximity to actual business ownership."],

  "Description": ["They're at it again. That delightful duo of disaster - Tom & Jerry! And now that Jerry's nephew Tuffy is coming for a visit, you can be sure things are going to get even wilder!\n\nAs Jerry, it's up to you to outwit Tom in a mad dash from the edge of town to the safety of your mouse hole back home. In the 2-player version, you or a friend can take on the role of Tuffy, who comes to visit his uncle Jerry and gets caught up in the chase! 12 levels of action start at the Movie Theater where you must make your way across the marquee and then through the film projector! Then it's on to the Junk Yard where you'll have to make your way out of a hazardous maze filled with old tires and rusty pipes. Next it's the treacherous Toy Store and it's army of wind-up toys. Every location is an adventure in itself, filled with hidden dangers and wild surprises - especially that crafty ol' cat, Tom! And once you make it inside the house, the action really heats up in the Kitchen and on into the Living Room, where a whole lot of trouble stands between you and your mouse hole. So, get your tail into gear, little mouse. 'Cause here comes that cat!"],
