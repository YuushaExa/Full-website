Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit is a vertical scrolling shoot ’em up in which the player controls a blue helicopter fighting against waves of enemy vehicles and ground turrets. Each mission takes the helicopter to a different part of the world, each with a distinctive if chromatically plain visual style.

The game’s power-ups, available by destroying smaller supply trucks driving across the screen, change the helicopter’s weapons but do not make them stronger. It’s even possible to collect the weaker original weapon again if the player is too careless. These range from a stronger forward-firing cannon (or laser) to guns that spread fire forwards and to the sides of the helicopter.

You can beat it more than once with enemies taking more hits on subsequent playthroughs.
