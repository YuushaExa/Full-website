Baseball is a game where the player can pitch, hit, field, and run just like in a real baseball game. The player can choose between USA and Japan modes, two different teams, and among a line-up of unique players. In the 1-player game, the player is against the computer, and the in the 2-player game, their friend is their opponent.
