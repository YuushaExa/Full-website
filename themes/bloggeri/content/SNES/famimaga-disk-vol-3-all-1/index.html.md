All One, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 3: All One, is a puzzle game in which the player controls a ladybug pushing over dice. The goal of each stage is to push all the dice onto their side so that their «one» side is facing upwards. The player is given a smaller first-person view window from the ladybug’s perspective to allow them to see the sides of each die and plan out their strategy.

As with other block-pushing puzzle games, the game becomes similar to Sokoban or Adventures of Lolo in its complexity as it progresses: there is often only a few (or just one) paths to successfully solving a stage and the player will need to restart if they make a mistake.
