Ushiro ni Tatsu Shojo is the successor of and a prequel to Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Kokeisha, and is the second game of the Famicom Tantei Club series. Its scenario was written by Nagihiro Asama, based on the concept by Yoshio Sakamoto.Kenji Yamamoto composed the game music. The popularity of Part I: Kieta Kokeisha prompted the release of this sequel, which employed the similar graphic-adventure gameplay. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Power cartridge rewriting service for the Super Famicom in 1998 with improved graphics and sound.

The objective is to solve two cases; the murder of a schoolgirl investigating her school’s ghost story, and an older murder nearing legal expiration. Like the previous game in the series, the game progresses as the player chooses from a set of commands displayed on a menu. These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game’s environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.
