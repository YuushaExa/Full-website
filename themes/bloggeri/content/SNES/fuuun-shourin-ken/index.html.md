In Fuuun Shourin Ken, you control a rising martial artist who strives to defeat other great fighters. To do so, you must utilize a wide array of attacks to defeat your opponent before they knock you out first. You will compete in six different scenes against 13 different opponents. The game follows in the vein of Yie Ar Kung-Fu, and predates the original Street Fighter by only a couple of months. It features similar concepts such as a distinction between punch and kick attacks, relative directions, and a health bar for each fighter, depicted as a series of paper fans.
