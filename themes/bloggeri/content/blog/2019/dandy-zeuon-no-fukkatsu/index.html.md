A conversion port of the Atari 8-Bit computer game Dandy. Though it has been changed quite a bit for it’s Japanese audience and doesn’t resemble the original game very much at all.

The view is overhead and much like Zelda you walk around and explore while using your sword to defeat various enemies. There are various dungeons and villages you can visit and the game even has a day/night cycle.
