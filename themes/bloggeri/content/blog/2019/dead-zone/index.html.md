Dead Zone is a futuristic digital comic and text adventure game by Sunsoft. In the space calendar 0385, the Earth suffers from overpopulation and humans started to build space colonies. Kirk, Dead Zone’s protagonist, works for the Earth federation’s space development office. He is a brilliant engineer in space physics and he works for Sirius’ third planet colony. He also got engaged with his beloved girlfriend Marry but had to postpone their wedding because of work obligations. Five months later, Kirk accompanied by his robot Carry , decides to meet Marry at last and to prepare the ceremony. But when he finally gets to the space station, everything is strangely quiet. Suddenly, a beam of light hits him. He wakes up sometimes later inside a sort of underground graveyard, pieces of dismantled robots surrounding him.

In a traditional digital comic/text adventure game fashion, the screen shows a large view of the surroundings. and the bottom displays simple action commands such as see, take or push. However all these commands and in-game text are in Japanese. One of the original feature of the game is to use real sampled sounds in places which is very unusual for the time.
