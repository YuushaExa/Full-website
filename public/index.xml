      <description>An update of sorts to Golf. Players get to take control of Nintendo’s mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in Japan.
Players can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play. Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor.</description>

      <description>Clox, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 4: Clox, is a falling blocks puzzle game that is superficially similar to Tetris or Columns. Single clock faces depicting one of four angles fall from the top and the player needs to manipulate and place them so they can form larger objects, such as simple formations like squares, diamonds and hourglass shapes to more object-intensive shapes like octagons and hexagons.
The four angles include 180 degree lines («12:30»), 90 degree lines («12:15»), 135 degree lines («~12:22») and 45 degree lines («~12:07»).</description>

      <description>Akuu Senki Raijin is a vertical shooter where the player controls a mecha that transforms into a starfighter. Like Square’s earlier semi-classic Thexder, the player can opt to change between the two modes of their craft at certain points during each level. Upon touching ground as the mecha, the player is occasionally able to find other directions to continue exploring as a spaceship, presenting both vertical-scrolling and side-scrolling shoot-’em-up sections.</description>

      <guid>https://yuushaexa.github.io/famicom/a-train/</guid>
      <description>The first game in the A-Ressha de Ikou («Let’s Take the A-Train») series, which would eventually become known overseas as A-Train. The goal of the game is to build a prosperous railroad company. Unlike the second (Railroad Empire) and third (A-Train) games in the series, the original A-Ressha de Ikou never saw an international release.
Some of the games influenced by later entries in this series include the SimCity series (and in turn the wider Sim/Sims franchise) and the Railroad Tycoon series (and in turn, the wider Sid Meier franchise).</description>

      <description>A companion title to the earlier Japan Course, Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course focuses on American courses. As such, gameplay is similar, with players choosing clubs and the speed at which they hit the ball. Once again, you control Mario and Luigi. Like the original, the game was compatible with the Disk Fax, so players could send their saved games and high scores to Nintendo. The gameplay influenced the later NES Open Tournament Golf, and many Mario sports games have been made since.</description>

      <description>Cocona World is a storybook-styled fantasy adventure game that is superficially similar to The Legend of Zelda and the other top-down action-adventure games that were inspired by it. The player controls a young witch exploring a fantasy land filled with creatures both friendly and hostile. The game contains far less action than others of its ilk, emphasizing exploration and puzzle solving instead. There are also minigames to be found across Cocona World as well.</description>

      <description>Adian No Tsue is not a traditional adventure game — It is most and foremost an educational game designed to appeal to a young audience. It is also the first installment of a series of games released in Japan by SunSoft. The player takes control of a courageous knight and the game follows a traditional overhead display which somehow bears some resemblance to Nintendo’s Zelda. Each room is usually filled up with monsters and four doors lead to other surrounding rooms, different locations or just hide special items.</description>

All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. «When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come…» And indeed, they come — the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil knight Garland, and then the real journey begins.</description>

      <description>Players explore an Egyptian town and ruins from a first-person perspective. The game combines role-playing game elements with an adventure game-like interface. Players may purchase items from shops, though some shopkeepers must be defeated in battle before trading. Battles are turn-based, with options to fight, use items, or flee. Players accumulate experience points by succeeding in battle and «level up» after gaining enough experience, which increases their stamina. Randomly encountered battles with enemies may happen at any time, including when paused to examine the inventory.</description>

The game sends Bam into a forest where he has to defeat all sorts of monsters. Defeated enemies drop fire elements which can be collected and used as currency inside the shops scattered around the game.</description>

      <description>This earlier version of the game we known as Jackal in the west lacks some of the content that were later added to its NES counterpart, due to the fact that it was released in disk card format rather than on a ROM cartridge. Namely, the stages in the FDS versions scrolls vertically only, have different layouts and are much shorter as a result. The beach stage is not featured in the FDS version and thus, the ruins (Stage 2 in the NES version) serves as the introductory stage instead.</description>

She wanders the house, occasionally doing activities like exercising, reading, brushing her teeth, feeding herself, sleeping, or even playing a game on her Famicom.</description>

      <description>Our hero, Bomberman, worked in a bomb factory located in an underground labyrinth. He grew very bored making bombs day in and day out. One day, he learned of a rumor that stated if a robot could ever escape the labyrinth and reach the surface of the world, his wish would be granted and he would become human. Bomberman is determined to find out if this rumor is true.
Based on an earlier MSX game of the same name, Hudson Soft dramatically improved the game for its Famicom release by adding a number of enemies, horizontally scrolling stages, and the power-ups that make keeping Bomberman alive so worthwhile.</description>

      <description>A conversion port of the Atari 8-Bit computer game Dandy. Though it has been changed quite a bit for it’s Japanese audience and doesn’t resemble the original game very much at all.
The view is overhead and much like Zelda you walk around and explore while using your sword to defeat various enemies. There are various dungeons and villages you can visit and the game even has a day/night cycle.</description>

      <description>Hong Kong, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 1: Hong Kong, is a Shanghai variant in which players must remove specified tiles from a pattern. The player can select which pattern (from pyramids and hourglasses to more complex designs) from which to draw tiles as well as inputting a three letter code which offers several thousand possible combinations of the tiles within that pattern.
Rather than removing tiles in pairs on the edge of the pattern in order to access buried tiles, as is the norm in Shanghai, the player can select any tile on the board as long as it corresponds to the tile the game requests.</description>

      <description>Chitei Tairiku Ordola («Underground Continent Ordola») is a Famicom Disk System action platformer from SunSoft and the third part of their Chinou Game Series, each borrowing an existing NES game’s model (in Ordola’s case, Atlantis no Nazo) and adding arithmetic problems to it. In Ordola, the actual math puzzles are relegated to an ancillary mini-game found on the disk.
The goal of the game is to help a young explorer pass through the underground world of Ordola, taking out enemies along the way with his bombs.</description>
