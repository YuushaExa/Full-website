Players accumulate experience points by succeeding in battle and «level up» after gaining enough experience, which increases their stamina. Randomly encountered battles with enemies may happen at any time, including when paused to examine the inventory.</description>

      <description>Our hero, Bomberman, worked in a bomb factory located in an underground labyrinth. He grew very bored making bombs day in and day out. One day, he learned of a rumor that stated if a robot could ever escape the labyrinth and reach the surface of the world, his wish would be granted and he would become human. Bomberman is determined to find out if this rumor is true.
Based on an earlier MSX game of the same name, Hudson Soft dramatically improved the game for its Famicom release by adding a number of enemies, horizontally scrolling stages, and the power-ups that make keeping Bomberman alive so worthwhile.</description>

      <description>A conversion port of the Atari 8-Bit computer game Dandy. Though it has been changed quite a bit for it’s Japanese audience and doesn’t resemble the original game very much at all.
The view is overhead and much like Zelda you walk around and explore while using your sword to defeat various enemies. There are various dungeons and villages you can visit and the game even has a day/night cycle.</description>

      <description>Chitei Tairiku Ordola («Underground Continent Ordola») is a Famicom Disk System action platformer from SunSoft and the third part of their Chinou Game Series, each borrowing an existing NES game’s model (in Ordola’s case, Atlantis no Nazo) and adding arithmetic problems to it. In Ordola, the actual math puzzles are relegated to an ancillary mini-game found on the disk.
The goal of the game is to help a young explorer pass through the underground world of Ordola, taking out enemies along the way with his bombs.</description>

      <description>The game’s setting takes place seven years after the original Castlevania. The prologue begins when Simon visits his family’s resting ground. His back is critically injured from his last encounter with Dracula in the previous game. He suddenly feels someone’s presence, and turns to see a young woman standing within the mist. She tells him that a curse was placed upon him by Dracula during their last battle, and that he does not have long to live.</description>
