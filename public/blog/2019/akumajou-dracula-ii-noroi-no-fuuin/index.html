          <p>The game’s setting takes place seven years after the original Castlevania. The prologue begins when Simon visits his family’s resting ground. His back is critically injured from his last encounter with Dracula in the previous game. He suddenly feels someone’s presence, and turns to see a young woman standing within the mist. She tells him that a curse was placed upon him by Dracula during their last battle, and that he does not have long to live. The woman continues to say that the curse can be undone if he resurrects Dracula himself. She further explains that Dracula’s body was split into five different parts after his defeat seven years ago, and Simon must recover these and bring them to the ruins of Dracula’s castle. There, he must seal Dracula and defeat him. Before disappearing, the unknown woman says she cannot guarantee that this will destroy Dracula permanently.</p>
<p>Dracula II — Noroi no Fuuin (Lit. «Dracula II: The Seal of the Curse») is an action-adventure game produced by Konami. It was originally released for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan in 1987, and for the NES in North America in 1988. It is the second Castlevania title released for the NES, following the original Castlevania. Set in 1698, seven years after the events of the first installment, the player once again assumes the role of vampire hunter Simon Belmont, who is on a journey to undo a curse placed on him by Dracula at the end of their previous encounter. Small differences exist between the Japanese version and the American version. Specifically the Japanese version takes advantage of the expanded FM processing capabilities of the FDS hardware to produce better sound, but it contains load scenes when entering or exiting any town or mansion. The FDS version also has three save slots instead of the NES password system.</p>
