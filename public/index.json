Players get to take control of Nintendo’s mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in Japan.\nPlayers can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play. Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each hole in as few strokes as possible.\nWhen on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so they can get into a rhythm using this meter.\nThis game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the player’s information to Nintendo’s headquarters. This information was used for a contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden colored disk version of this game. This golden disk version of the game contained an exclusive course that was not present on the original version of this game.\nDeveloped by [HAL Laboratory](/search?q=HAL%20Laboratory?\u0026max-results=12) Published by [Nintendo](/search?q=Nintendo?\u0026max-results=12) Genre: [Sports](/search?q=Sports?\u0026max-results=12) Platform: [Famicom Disk System](/search/label/%40famicom?\u0026amp;max-results=12) Release Date: February 21, 1987 YouTube: [Family Computer Golf: Japan Course Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFgDqscCyMY)![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]()","permalink":"https://yuushaexa.github.io/snes/family-computer-golf-japan-course/","tags":null,"title":"Family Computer Golf: Japan Course"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Developed by [HAL Laboratory](/search?q=HAL%20Laboratory?\u0026max-results=12) Published by [Nintendo](/search?q=Nintendo?\u0026max-results=12) Genre: [Sports](/search?q=Sports?\u0026max-results=12) Platform: [Famicom Disk System](/search/label/%40famicom?\u0026amp;max-results=12) Release Date: 1987 YouTube: Family Computer Golf: Japan Course Prize Cart Gameplay![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]()","permalink":"https://yuushaexa.github.io/snes/family-computer-golf-japan-course-prize-cart/","tags":null,"title":"Family Computer Golf: Japan Course Prize Cart"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Clox, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 4: Clox, is a falling blocks puzzle game that is superficially similar to Tetris or Columns. Single clock faces depicting one of four angles fall from the top and the player needs to manipulate and place them so they can form larger objects, such as simple formations like squares, diamonds and hourglass shapes to more object-intensive shapes like octagons and hexagons.\nThe four angles include 180 degree lines («12:30»), 90 degree lines («12:15»), 135 degree lines («~12:22») and 45 degree lines («~12:07»). Once a clock face is placed, the lines from it extend to connect to any other lines that surround it. Placing lines in such a way that it forms a shape — for example, placing four 90 degree clocks in such a way to form a square — earns the player points and removes the clocks used to form the shape. Larger shapes are more risky but earn more points.\nThe player is given some leeway to recover from mistakes: should the player hold the down button to make a clock fall faster, it’ll destroy any clocks underneath. A misplacement, therefore, can be rectified with a correctly positioned clock if it falls quickly enough to crush the offending clock. However, the player can only do this a limited number of times per stage.\nDeveloped by [Tokuma Shoten](/search?q=Tokuma%20Shoten?\u0026max-results=12) Published by [Tokuma Shoten](/search?q=Tokuma%20Shoten?\u0026max-results=12) Genre: [Puzzle](/search?q=Puzzle?\u0026max-results=12) Platform: [Famicom Disk System](/search/label/%40famicom?\u0026amp;max-results=12) Release Date: April 19, 1991 YouTube: Famimaga Disk Vol. 4: Clox Gameplay![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]()","permalink":"https://yuushaexa.github.io/snes/famimaga-disk-vol-4-clox/","tags":null,"title":"Famimaga Disk Vol. 4: Clox"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Baseball is a game where the player can pitch, hit, field, and run just like in a real baseball game.

Winds don’t blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. «When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come…» And indeed, they come — the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil knight Garland, and then the real journey begins.\nFinal Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. He also gives the characters names.\nIn the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run). Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price.\nSpells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories — white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons-style spell slots, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.\nDeveloped by [Square Co., Ltd.](/search?q=Square%20Co.,%20Ltd.?\u0026max-results=12) Published by [Square](/search?q=Square?\u0026max-results=12) Genre: [Role-Playing](/search?q=Role-Playing?\u0026max-results=12) Platform: [Famicom Disk System](/search/label/%40famicom?\u0026amp;max-results=12) Release Date: December 18, 1987 YouTube: Final Fantasy Gameplay![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]()","permalink":"https://yuushaexa.github.io/snes/final-fantasy/","tags":null,"title":"Final Fantasy"},{"categories":null,"contents":"All One, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 3: All One, is a puzzle game in which the player controls a ladybug pushing over dice.

Players accumulate experience points by succeeding in battle and «level up» after gaining enough experience, which increases their stamina.

Pushing a block adjacent to another of a different type causes whichever was the inferior (e.g. with paper and rock, rock is the inferior) to vanish. In addition, each block has a «strength» which is signified by its color: green is level 1, yellow is level 2 and red is level 3. If a green block is pushed next to an inferior red block, the red block will instead become yellow instead of vanishing (and then green with a subsequent superior block, and then will vanish after a third).\nGameplay revolves around finding the right blocks to push together to clear a way to the exit. Not every block needs to be eliminated: just those that are direct obstacles between the player and the end of the stage.\nThe game adopts a familiar veneer of the typical 8-bit fantasy RPG: The player starts in a small town in which they can talk to NPCs and purchase power-ups, they can visit the King in his castle to begin their quest and they can visit the dungeons in which the puzzles are found (after receiving permission from the King).\nJanken Disk Jou has the distinction of being the very last game ever produced for the Famicom Disk System.

The baby can use this to its advantage, riding the enemies while they are floating, kicking them to various directions, making them bounce off walls, using them as projectiles to hit other enemies, etc. Such strategies are necessary when dealing with the bosses you encounter.

The sprite used for Bomberman actually came from an enemy sprite used in Hudson Soft’s very successful Famicom conversion of Lode Runner. One of the robotic enemies that chased the Lode Runner hero learned that he might become human if he can climb fifty underground floors to escape from his plant and reach the surface of the world. The only weapon at Bomberman’s disposal, of course, are bombs.\nDeveloped by [Hudson Soft](/search?q=Hudson%20Soft?\u0026max-results=12) Published by [Hudson Soft](/search?q=Hudson%20Soft?\u0026max-results=12) Genre: [Action](/search?q=Action?\u0026max-results=12) Platform: [Famicom Disk System](/search/label/%40famicom?\u0026amp;max-results=12) Release Date: April 24, 1990 YouTube: [Bomberman Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svpsSoFoPY)![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]()","permalink":"https://yuushaexa.github.io/famicom/bomberman/","tags":null,"title":"Bomberman"},{"categories":["Web development","Blogging"],"contents":"A conversion port of the Atari 8-Bit computer game Dandy.

While the story of the game revolves around finding a stone, there is no actual stone to discover.

However, points are scored based on how many other tiles surround the selected tile: A maximum of 320 points are awarded for tiles completely surrounded on all six sides by other tiles. Any tiles that aren’t «standing» on at least one other tile will fall off the board causing a premature game over: players need to balance earning points by removing entrenched tiles while ensuring that no tile will fall off the table as a result of the removal.\nBecause the game is not a true version of Shanghai it is named after another Chinese city — Hong Kong — instead.\nDeveloped by [Onion Software](/search?q=Onion%20Software?\u0026max-results=12) Published by [Tokuma Shoten](/search?q=Tokuma%20Shoten?\u0026max-results=12) Genre: [Puzzle](/search?q=Puzzle?\u0026max-results=12) Platform: [Famicom Disk System](/search/label/%40famicom?\u0026amp;max-results=12) Release Date: March 23, 1990 YouTube: [Famimaga Disk Vol. 1: Hong Kong Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqLPUcnlB3o)![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]()","permalink":"https://yuushaexa.github.io/snes/famimaga-disk-vol-1-hong-kong/","tags":null,"title":"Famimaga Disk Vol. 1: Hong Kong"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Chitei Tairiku Ordola («Underground Continent Ordola») is a Famicom Disk System action platformer from SunSoft and the third part of their Chinou Game Series, each borrowing an existing NES game’s model (in Ordola’s case, Atlantis no Nazo) and adding arithmetic problems to it.
