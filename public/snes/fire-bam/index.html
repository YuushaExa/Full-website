          <p>Bam must explore a world and «unfold» it into its full size by exploring towers and defeating boss characters inside. In addition to the starting equipment, five weapons, shields, and boots can be purchased or obtained to give the player a degree of customization.</p>
<p>The game sends Bam into a forest where he has to defeat all sorts of monsters. Defeated enemies drop fire elements which can be collected and used as currency inside the shops scattered around the game. Special items and new weapons can be purchased this way. Bam will eventually discover tall towers, each one of which needs to be visited and the bosses hiding within defeated. Once a tower is completed, the area around the player expands to the left and right, creating new territory for the player to explore. In addition, new buildings and shops appear in the player’s home territory as towers are completed.</p>
